ChessBuddy
==========

Play chess with [Go][1], HTML5, [WebSockets][2] and random strangers!

* Demo: <http://chess.tux21b.org:8000/>

Hint: Open the page in two different tabs, if there aren't any other
visitors around.


Quick Start
-----------

ChessBuddy is compatible with Go 1. Use the [go tool][3] to install the latest
version of ChessBuddy with the following command:

    go get github.com/lavren1974/ChessBuddy

This will install a new command `ChessBuddy` in your path (usually
`$GOPATH/bin/ChessBuddy`). Start the HTTP server with the default arguments:

    ChessBuddy -http=:8000 -time=5m

Visit <http://localhost:8000/>, wait for a friend and start playing a game of
chess.

You can use `go get -u github.com/lavren1974/ChessBuddy` to update ChessBuddy.


Features
--------

 * web service connects all visitors in pairs and maintains the chess games
 * JavaScript client displays the chess board using the HTML 5 canvas API
 * Time control: 5 minutes (configurable) per side, sudden death
 * move history displays all moves using standard algebraic notation (SAN)


Missing / Planned Features
--------------------------

* support for underpomotion (currently pawns are always promoted to queens)
* add some animations to the javascript interface
* add a couple of AI players (maybe by connecting another engine such as
  gnuchess or crafty) which can be selected if no other visitors are available
* starting new games without refreshing the page
